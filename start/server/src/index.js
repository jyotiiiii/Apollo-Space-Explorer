  /*
The context function defined above is called once for every GraphQL operation 
that clients send to our server. The return value of this function becomes the 
context argument that's passed to every resolver that runs as part of that operation.
 
Here's what our context function does:

1. Obtain the value of the Authorization header (if any) included in the incoming request.
2. Decode the value of the Authorization header.
3. If the decoded value resembles an email address, obtain user details for that email address 
from the database and return an object that includes those details in the user field.

By creating this context object at the beginning of each operation's execution, all of our 
resolvers can access the details for the logged-in user and perform actions specifically for 
that user.*/
